<h1>Zippy, The Werewolf reluctantly takes the files</h1>
    <p>He'll send you a mail when they're properly zipped and ready for pickup. <br>
    He does how(l)ever not promise to keep them around for long. <br>
    Beware the first full moon: For he will eat your .zip files when he transforms!</p>
